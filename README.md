# Publication in Nature Human Behaviour
This project examined temporal financial preferences and implications for reducing economic inequality in collaboration with Columbia University and the Junior Researcher Programme (JRP). The project involved 13,629 participants across 61 countries and found that temporal discounting - the tendency to discount future gains for present ones - was robust across geographic regions yet covaried alongside economic inequality and wider financial contexts. This project was published in Nature Human Behaviour in 2022.
